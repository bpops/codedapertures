CodedApertures is a python module that allows one to easily generate and display common coded aperture patterns. Coded apertures are a spatial encoding technique for straight-line optics, wherein traditional lensing (e.g., visible light) is not possible. Even wherein tradiational lensing is possible, there may be other advantages (infinite depth of field). Coded apertures may therefore be used for hard x-ray and gamma-ray imaging for astrophysics, medical imaging, and homeland security applications.

### Usage

Install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/codedapertures/) with PIP:
```
pip install codedapertures
```

Coded patterns that this package can generate:

| class | coded aperture |
|---|---|
| rand1d | random array (1D) |
| rand2d | random array (2D) |
| ura | uniformly redundant array |
| mura | modified uniformly redundant array |
| pnp | pseudo-noise product array |
| randhex | random array (hexagonal) |
| shura | skew-hadamard uniformly redundant array |
| hura | hexagonal uniformly redundant array |

Note that for consistency with relevant decoding algorithms, we define the
binary meaning as such
| val | mask pixel |
|---|---|
| 0 | closed |
| 1 | open |

See [demo.ipynb](https://github.com/bpops/codedapertures/blob/master/demo.ipynb) for examples of use.

This package will use an axial coordinate system for the hexagonal grids. It will follow the concept outlined at https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#map-storage.
