### Coded Aperture Production in PYthon

CAPPY is a python module that allows one to easily generate and display common coded aperture patterns. Coded apertures are a spatial encoding technique for straight-line optics, wherein traditional lensing (e.g., visible light) is not possible. Coded apertures may therefore be used for hard x-ray and gamma-ray imaging for astrophysics, medical imaging, and homeland security applications.

See `example.ipynb` for examples of use.
